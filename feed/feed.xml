		<title>Small farms grow the majority of the world&#39;s food</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There has been a zombie statistic floating around for the last 10 years: small farms grow 70-80% of the world&#39;s food. There was little transparency on the methods behind this statistic, yet major news outlets, NGOs, and multilateral agencies were quoting it to garner support for small farms. I led a project to look into this stat and found farms under 2 ha in size grow around 30%, which is still an &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-nature-of-food/small-farms-grow-a-large-portion-of-the-worlds-food-59ed07019a9&quot;&gt;impressive figure!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore our new dataset on how much food is produced by differently sized farms. For each of the 55 countries, we found nationally  representative surveys and censuses that asked farmers how much of each  crop they produced. Using this information, we calculated how much total crop production (in kilocalories) each farm size produced. Because  different types of crops are allocated towards human food, animal feed,  processed non-food goods, seed for planting, or are wasted during  storage and transportation, we then worked out how each farm size  allocated their production. All together, our dataset has &amp;gt; 150 crops from 55 countries. Click each tab to find out how much food, feed,  processed goods, seed, or waste small farms are producing and how much  land they&#39;re using compared to larger farms - and check out how crop  diversity differs across farm sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>A look at farms across country borders</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been fascinated with looking at countries borders. Agricultural land-use polices, a countries natural resources access, and/or its connection to  international markets can drastically affect the size of a field. Here is a little Arc Story Map I made to highlight a few interesting border regions.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colours-of-food-security.com/exhibition/a-cultivated-planet/&quot;&gt;Colours of Food Security&lt;/a&gt; is a series of striking images that use colour and data-driven visualization of decades of scientific research  to paint a picture of the global food system today. These data have  enabled the undertaking of a broad range of policy analyses on the problems inherent in the way agriculture operates on a global scale.  They have been used by a range of scientists, governments, NGOs, and food activists, and are featured in a wide range of news outlets and  media, including National Geographic Magazine, The New York Times, and  The Economist. The research underlying this exhibit helps to inform decision-making and solutions towards a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was a large collaborative effort that I helped support. For full acknowledgements please visit the exhibit&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colours-of-food-security.com/about/&quot;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

Articles were queried using the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gdeltproject.org/&quot;&gt;GDELT&lt;/a&gt; project, which streams news articles from over 100 countries every 15 minutes and codes them into events, actors, locations, and sentiments (e.g., the tone of the article). This map, made with Google BigQuery and CartoDB, is in beta to give a picture of what GDELT can do for the land grab monitoring community.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Data on 3 million farmers</title>
		<link href="https://myurl.com/posts/RuLIS/"/>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The FAO Statistics Division, the World Bank and IFAD have joined forces to build &lt;strong&gt;RuLIS&lt;/strong&gt;, as a tool to support policies for reducing rural poverty. &lt;strong&gt;Information on agricultural&lt;/strong&gt; income and rural livelihoods is crucial for the formulation of evidence-based development policies&amp;quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/in-action/rural-livelihoods-dataset-rulis&quot;&gt;RuLIS website&lt;/a&gt;{:target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;}).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rural Livelihood Information System (RuLIS) is a dataset of nationally representative surveys from 37 countries. There are around 280 variables and data is available at the micro-level (e.g., individual farmer responses). It will become open access later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interactive app shows all the household variables available, for which countries they are available, and how many survey years for each variable. I am in collaboration with RuLIS to further explore how their dataset can help understand key dimensions of vulnerable farmers and their incomes - an effort to support achieving the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/sustainable-development-goals/indicators&quot;&gt;Sustainable Development Goal 2.3&lt;/a&gt;{:target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;}, &amp;quot;doubling the income of small-scale farmers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
